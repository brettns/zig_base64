# Zig Base64

As a way to learn Zig, I wanted to try implementing a Base64 decoder. Iâ€™ll probably add encoding at some point too.

It's mostly implemented through bitwise operations.

Using an unsigned 32-bit integer as a queue, we shift 6 bits at a time into it. When there are 8 or more bits in the queue, we dequeue a byte by right-shifting the oldest inserted 8 bits and casting to u8.
